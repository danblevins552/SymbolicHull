    Compute the lower convex hull of a set of points in N-dimensional space.

    ----------
    points : (M, N) ndarray
        Array of M points in N-dimensional space. The last dimension (N-th) 
        is treated as the 'energy' coordinate.

        lower convex hull in N-dimensional space. Each row of 'lower_hull'
